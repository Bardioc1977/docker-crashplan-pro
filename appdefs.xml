        <title level="2">Taking Over Existing Backup</title>
        <content>
If this container is replacing a CrashPlan installation (from Linux, Windows,
MAC or another Docker container), your existing backup can be taken over to
avoid re-uploading all your data.

To proceed, make sure to carefully read the [official documentation].

Here is a summary of what needs to be done:
  1. Start CrashPlan Docker container.  Make sure the configuration directory
     is not mapped to a folder used by a different CrashPlan container.
  2. Sign in to your account.
  3. Perform an adoption.  There is a gray banner asking you to do so.
  4. Once done, you will probably see missing items in the file selection.  This
     is normal, since path to your files is different in the container.
  5. Update the file selection by re-adding your files.  **Do not unselect
     missing items yet**.
  6. Perform a backup.  Because of deduplication, files will not be uploaded
     again.
  7. Once the backup is terminated, you can remove missing items **if you
     don't care about file versions**.  Else, keep missing items.

        <title level="2">Migrating From CrashPlan for Home</title>
        <content>
*CrashPlan for Home* [being decommissioned], users using this version have the
choice to migrate their account to *CrashPlan PRO* (aka *CrashPlan for Small
Business*).  Thus, using this container becomes a great choice for these
users.

To perform the transition, you need to:
  - [Migrate your account].
  - If *CrashPlan for Home* installation is provided by the `jlesage/crashplan`
    Docker container:
    - Keep the configuration directory used by `jlesage/crashplan` container
      (i.e. the host directory mapped to `/config`).
    - Run this container by re-using the same configuration directory.  To do
      so, map the `/config` folder to the same host directory used by the
      `jlesage/crashplan` container.
  - Else, for all other installations (Windows, Linux, Mac, other Docker
    containers):
    - Start this container, by making sure the configuration directory is
      mapped to a new, empty host directory.
    - Follow instructions detailed in the
      [Taking Over Existing Backup](#taking-over-existing-backup) section.

        <title level="3">Crashes / Maximum Amount of Allocated Memory</title>
        <content>
If CrashPlan crashes unexpectedly with large backups, try to increase the
maximum amount of memory CrashPlan is allowed to use. This can be done by:

  1. Setting the `CRASHPLAN_SRV_MAX_MEM` environment variable.  See the
     [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for more details.
  2. Using the [solution provided by CrashPlan] from its support site.

        <title level="3">Inotify's Watch Limit</title>
        <content>
If CrashPlan exceeds inotify's max watch limit, real-time file watching cannot
work properly and the inotify watch limit needs to be increased on the **host**.

For more details, see the CrashPlan's [Linux real-time file watching errors]
article.
